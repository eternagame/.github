<!--
    Thank you for submitting a pull request! We appreciate your time and effort.
    Please make sure you have read our contributing guidelines before posting an PR
    https://github.com/eternagame/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
-->

<!--
    First, if you are submitting to one of our "next gen" repositories (workspace-helpers,
    eternagame.org-next, or eternajs-next), ensure that your PR title follows the conventional
    commit standard. This will be verified by our continuous integration.
    
    The general format is: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`. For libraries published outside the scope of
    this repository, if a breaking change is introduced, you will also need to add a `!` before `:`.
    Example: `fix(core): Fixes a problem with the core module`
    
    You can find a list of types at https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json
    (`feat`, `fix`, and `docs` are probably the most likely)

    To find a list of valid scopes, take a look at the `scope:` issue labels in the repository you are
    submitting this PR to. Note that if you are adding a new scope and you use that scope in the same PR,
    the CI will fail. That is expected, as as that GitHub action needs to base its configuration on
    the master branch - the PR will be merged ignoring the check in that case.

    were they and why did you decide on this approach? Provide any additional context beyond what is
    recorded in the code (eg, comments) that could be useful if someone wants to understand what your
