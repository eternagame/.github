        For an application usage related issue, what are the exact steps that someone else could take
        that cause this behavior? This should have the minimum number of steps necessary, but provide
        all necessary steps in detail. Additionally, it should be reliable, occurring every time the
        steps are taken. In the case of a live Eterna application, please be sure to include a link
        if relevant.

        For a library usage related issue, provide a self-contained, concise snippet of code that can
        be used to reproduce the issue. For more complex issues provide a repo with the smallest sample
        that reproduces the bug. The code sample should be an SSCCE. See http://sscce.org/ for details.
        In short, please provide a code sample that we can copy/paste, run and reproduce.

        If you don't provide a detailed, reliable reproduction, we may not be able to identify and
        resolve the issue.
